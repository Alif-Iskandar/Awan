The purpose of this project is to design and develop a simple mobile application on the cloud.

Using MIT App Inventor, we managed to do this project where we are tasked to develop simple mobile application with integrating cloud computing technology.

## MyBMI

My Body Mass Index (BMI) Apps can be used to calculate your BMI value by inserting your weight and height. BMI is a scale that measures a 
person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight. It is used to estimate tissue mass. It is commonly used as a general 
indicator of whether a person's body weight is appropriate for their height. Specifically, the BMI value is used to determine whether a 
person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, based on where the value falls within the range. These BMI levels vary by 
geography and age, and are frequently further subdivided into subcategories like severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight 
or underweight can have serious health consequences, therefore while BMI is an inaccurate estimate of a healthy body weight, it can help 
determine whether further testing or action is necessary.


## Apps Features

We already improved the version for this apps and will keep continues to grow in the future. Letâ€™s take a look what's new on our MyBMI Apps. The app we developed, has the functionality as below:

- Save & Delete BMI Record
  - Every time users calculate their latest BMI, the record will be automatically added to the database.
  - User can delete the record back if they are no longer need the data.
  - Use TinyDB cloud storage in order to save:
    - Name
    - Height (in m)
    - Weight (in kg)
    - BMI value
    
- Bar Graph Chart
  - Apps can convert the data (BMI value) gained into a bar graph chart.
  - Learn more about chart through [ChartMaker](https://github.com/MillsCS215AppInventorProj/chartmaker)

- Pedometer
  - Simple pedometer has been included to the apps.
  - Pedometers are implemented to encourage the people to exercise by doing distance walked.
